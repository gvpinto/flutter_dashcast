                    Dan Gardner: software developer and accidental entrepreneur. Back in 2008 he needed to learn PHP/MySQL so he built a web application called RunPee.com. (It tells you the best time to run and pee during a movie without missing the best scenes.) The website became an international success and has evolved into a mobile application and business that has supported him and his family for the past 13+ years. In 2020 he and his wife rebuilt the RunPee app from scratch using Flutter. They both love the framework and continue to use it in freelance work today.

                    Thorsten is a Jazz musician turned developer and is excited about Node.js and its community.

The fast turnaround from idea to working module has proven addictive for him and led to lots of modules which ended up on github and/or npm.

In his free time he builds all kinds of things, including games, recently in Flutter and most recently in Rust.

Thorsten is @thlorenz on twitter and streams development of his projects on his twitch channel at twitch.tv/thlorenz.

He currently works at Cypress.io.

                    In everything I do, I believe in creativity and growing into excellence. The way I do this is by creating products and contents that are useful, beautiful and easy to use. I happen to create mobile apps! Currently an Android developer at Farmcrowdy Limited (No. 1 startup in Nigeria). I have 4 years experience developing Android apps, and I'm super excited to be part of the first people to launch an Android and iOS app using flutter in Nigeria.

                    Parth is a guy who is trying to grow up and do mature stuff and work but ends up designing, playing games (most of the time) or watching Movies/TV Series. Parth has lots of experience in designing user interfaces  &amp; front-end development. Parth uses Angular for Creating frontend, ionic and Flutter to create hybrid apps. Parth has mastery over some of the adobe creative suite apps.

Correction: In this episode I mentioned that VSCode is implemented by a community member.  Originally yes, but Google bought a year of his time, so he's working for the Google now.  Not sure when the renewal date is though.  Most of the differences between the IntelliJ plugin and the VSCode plugin are because the VSCode plugin architecture is more limited.

Thank you Randal L. Schwartz (https://twitter.com/merlyn ) for pointing this out!

                    Spanish engineer lost in Chicago. I am the organizer of the Chicago Flutter Meetup. I work for the BMW Group, where we craft the Android apps for BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce. When I am not coding, you’ll likely find me playing guitar, and trying to sing at the same time, although we can all agree that singing is not one of my strengths!
